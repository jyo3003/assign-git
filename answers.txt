•  What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 
 - The gitignore file is a plain text document that tells Git which files to ignore when you are doing your commit to the repository. Ignoring certain files is important because:
        1. The files can be system specific
        2. The file may contain specific data
        Following should be included in gitignore file for a java project:
            *.class
            *.log
            *. ctxt
            .mtj.tmp/
            *.jar
            *.war
            *.nar
            *.ear *.zip
            *.tar.gz
            *ar


•  What does fast-forward in git mean? 
  - When there is a straight line connecting the source branch and the target branch, the fast-forward merge can be used. Without adding an additional merge commit, fast-forward merge merely moves the source branch pointer to the target branch pointer.

•  Why should you have different branches? 
  - Branches give the team or developers the freedom to work independently.
  - It helps us organize the workflow efficiently.
  - It helps us isolate the developer’s work from the original source code and then merge it whenever necessary.

•  In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have? 
  - Any project can have as many repositories depending on the complexity of the project.
  - This can help different teams work on the same project simultaneously.
